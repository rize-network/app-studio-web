              React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is
              maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers
              and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of
              single-page or mobile applications.

              Hooks are functions that let you hook into React state and
              lifecycle features from function components. Hooks dont work
              inside classes â€” they let you use React without classes.

              JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be
              used with React and looks a lot like HTML. Because JSX is
              JavaScript, you can use variables inside it.
